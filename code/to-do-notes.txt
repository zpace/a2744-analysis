There are still negative fluxes for a couple bands in the SED, esp for the larger apertures around Y1.
Thought SExtractor accounted for background--or am I missing something?

Looks like we have images in e-/sec. How do we get to Jy? There seems to be an IRAF routine?
Except that seems to be contradicted by following paragraph.

m_AB = ZP - 2.512 log10(flux)
then find a conversion between Jy and m_AB
F[uJy] = 10**-(m_AB - 23.9)/2.512

so then F[uJy] = flux*10**(-2.512(ZP-23.9))
Make array of ZP, then multiply out

re-run SExtractor

# =====

plot Laporte flux values on top of my flux values
compute per-band correction factor for an isolated star
	assume all flux is contained at 2"
	correct from .5" to 2" by dividing by flux factor obtained from star COG
DONE
	
make ASCII catalog of all objects in the F160 band, with corrected fluxes in all bands.

# =====

select high-z galaxies, use ascii output files from eazy to plot SEDs for z > 3 cat
panels: SED, redshift dist. (computed from chi2), image cutout in F160, F814
Look at other sources (Zheng et al, Atek et al), cited in Laporte

./eazy -p zphot.param -z zphot.zeropoint # uses new zero-points

Look for catalog of spectroscopic redshifts for A2744

F_lambda = F_nu * (lambda/5500A)^-2

# =====

list F160 magnitude on top of ax3

plot tempa_z

replace err_full with err_cat

# =====

look for empty aperture errors email (July 15 thread)

for each band, define an empty_aperture error equal to sig_EA * sqrt(wht.75p()/wht) #wht in central pixel
#.75p() is weight at 75th percentile (numpy.percentile)
do all that in phot-sex-all in cat_correct, convert new errors to uJy

# =====

take out K-band and IRAC, scale ACS errors (single-template mode only), see effect on best-fit
constrain z < ~3, do plotting again

# =====

make a bunch of spectra.param files (each with one template included), for templates with epoch less than 700My (.7Gy)
change output directory specific to each template
get chi2 for every fit (constrained within 99% bounds), plot each fit w/ transparency according to chi2 (chi2 has to be less than (1, 4, 9) above chi2 minimum)

# =====

figure for paper
Panel 1: log p(z) with new K-band
Panel 2: SED with error bars (for favored z~8 peak and disfavored z~2 peak, indicate which is which)
Panel 3: range of models that fit the SED (ax2 from modelfit)

# =====

move panel 3 to separate figure
make panel 1 and panel 2 each square
linear wavelength units in SEDs
fix Angstrom label
extend SED y axis to negative, put light line at 0
remove individual panel labels
make observed photometry a more visible color
plot template photometry from obs_sed
make sure LaTeX font renders correctly
